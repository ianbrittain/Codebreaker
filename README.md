Codebreaker was my first C++ school project. The computer generates a random four digit code using the numbers 1-6. 
The objective is to guess the code in as few guess as possible. You have 12 attempts to guess the correct code.
The computer will guide you along the way telling you in one column if you have correctly guessed numbers and in another column
it will keep track of numbers that are correct, but misplaced in the sequence.
